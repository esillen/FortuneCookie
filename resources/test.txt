How do you tell when you run out of invisible ink?
How high could you go if you knew you wouldn't fall?
I can see up your nose.
I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody.
I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
I smile because I have no idea what's going on!
If a true sense of value is to be yours it must come through service.
